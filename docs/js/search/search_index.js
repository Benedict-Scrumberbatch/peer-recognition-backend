Notes\nPersistence\nThe database has persistence of information between sessions.  It however does not currently have any form of environmental persistence, nor does it have direct file support in the repo, instead it has a volume holding the information.\nConnection\nThe database is currently used by connecting to localhost:5432.\nSupport\nNest is an MIT-licensed open source project. It can grow thanks to the sponsors and support by the amazing backers.
